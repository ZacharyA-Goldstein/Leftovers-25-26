     *                     direction.
     * @param pathingPower this Vector points in the direction the robot needs to go to continue along
     *                     the Path.

     *                     much power to allocate to each wheel.

     * IMPORTANT NOTE: I did not intend for this to be used for anything other than the method above
     * this one in this class, so there will be errors if you input Vectors of length greater than maxPowerScaling,

     * isn't greater than maxPowerScaling. So, just don't use this elsewhere. There's gotta be a better way to do
     * whatever you're trying to do.

     * I know that this is used outside of this class, however, I created this method so I get to
     * use it if I want to. Also, it's only used once outside of the DriveVectorScaler class, and
     * it's used to scale Vectors, as intended.
